# Rock Paper Scissors - Fighter Edition

My take on The Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors assignment, with an MMA theme.

## 🎮 [Play the Game](https://codebylouis.github.io/odin-RockPaperScissors/)

## About

This is a browser-based Rock Paper Scissors game featuring three MMA fighters (Doumbe, Baki, and Zebo). Instead of rock/paper/scissors, you pick a fighter and battle against the computer in a best-of-5 match.

## What I Built

- Interactive fighter selection with hover effects
- Real fight GIF clips for each matchup
- Score tracking system (wins, losses, draws)
- Custom UI with MMA arena background and lighting effects

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox, animations, glassmorphism)
- JavaScript

## Fighter Rules

- Baki beats Doumbe
- Doumbe beats Zebo  
- Zebo beats Baki
